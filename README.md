##  Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent robotic arm that automates the gemstone cutting process through robotics and artificial intelligence. Traditional gem cutting in Sri Lanka is labor-intensive, requires high skill, and often results in inconsistency.

The proposed system introduces a **semi-autonomous robotic solution** capable of identifying, evaluating, and cutting gemstones with precision and minimal human intervention. 

The research integrates **machine learning, robotics, embedded systems, and 3D Modelling** to create a prototype that can intelligently analyze gem characteristics and execute optimized cutting operations.
